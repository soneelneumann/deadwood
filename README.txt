If you are having troubles running the game, compile all other .java files before you compile Deadwood.java.

When entering user input, keep in mind that the input is case sensitive. For example, when prompted the destiantion you wish to move, you must type "Main Street" instead of "main street". When entering locations or taking roles, make sure you type the location\role exactly how it appears on the board.

All buttons are displayed at all times, but pressing an action button that the player can not perform will result in a Message Dialog explaining how the option is unavailable.

Stats of each player are shown by JLabels of text displayed below the buttons, which updates automatically as the players take turns or get paid rewards trhough acting.

When the game is finished, an end game prompt will appear. After this you are free to close the window.
